# hotel-profit-prediction
This study will determine whether a new hotel will be profitable in given location or not. The application employs different set of machine learning algorithms to 
forecast performance indicators linked to certain locations. The learning process begins with observations and data. 
These are provided so that the models can look for trends in data and make smarter conclusions. 
With a detailed investigation and with the right data containing the features this problem can be solved by machine learning. 
Since we are told to predict if the new hotel location will be profitable or not, we can classify it as a Classification problem. 
The data will include the target values of previous hotel locations. 
Therefore, this is a case of Supervised learning with Classification.

The machine learning preferred for this case are -:
• Decision Tree Classifier
The capacity to use multiple feature subsets and decision  rules at different stages of classification is the major benefit of this classifier.
The decision tree has a tree-like form, the rationale  behind it is simple to comprehend. When the dataset has an attribute that is key to decision making,
a Decision Tree is preferable.
• Support Vector Machine (SVM)
When the number of features in the dataset is large relative to the number of data points, we can use SVM. Using a technique known as the kernel trick, 
SVMs may efficiently execute non linear classification. It is a very good classifier; however, it isn't perfect.
• Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is an effective approach for resolving binary classification problems especially if there is no correlation between the independent variables.
